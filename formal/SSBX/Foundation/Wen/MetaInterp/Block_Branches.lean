# Block_Branches — executeBlocks for `branchYaoEq i j t` and `branchShiEq sh t`

These two opcodes are the conditional pc-update primitives:

  branchYaoEq i j t : if cur.1.yaoAt i = cur.1.yaoAt j
                       then pc := t
                       else pc := pc + 1
  branchShiEq sh t : if cur.2 = sh
                       then pc := t
                       else pc := pc + 1

In META terms, sim.pc updates correspond to **rewriting the pc-counter
prefix** of `encMetaHistory regHex sim` (cf. `encMetaHistory_nop_step`
which only handles the +1 case via `regDataCell` head-prepend).

## §0  Design choice — per-(opcode × params) Lean-level specialization

Following the same **Option F** convention adopted in
`Block_SetShi_FlipYao.lean` and `Block_HuCuoZong.lean`, we Lean-level
parameterize each block by its concrete operands.  For branches that
means a Lean function `executeBlock_branchYaoEq (i j : Fin 6) (t : Nat)
…` that emits one block per `(i, j, t)` triple, and similarly
`executeBlock_branchShiEq (sh : Shi) (t : Nat) …` per `(sh, t)`.

The dispatcher routes control to the right pre-compiled block based on
the runtime param cells (consumed by fetch+dispatch — outside this file).

This trades program size for proof tractability: the meta-program grows
combinatorially in the operand space, but each block becomes a simple
straight-line program whose local effect mirrors the ISA-level branch
opcode directly.

## §0.1  The two execution paths

Each block is a 2-instruction program of the form

  [ <branch op> ; jump fetchOffset ]

There are two dynamic paths:

* **Fall-through** (condition FALSE): the branch op increments META.pc
  by 1 (to position 1), the next instruction `jump fetchOffset` fires,
  META.pc := fetchOffset.  This is structurally identical to a 2-step
  run of `[ nop ; jump fetchOffset ]` from the local-effect standpoint.
  The corresponding sim-side encoding bridge is the **same head-prepend
  of `regDataCell regHex`** as for `nop`/`interlace`/`complement`/`reverse`.

* **Branch-taken** (condition TRUE): after the branch op, META.pc := t.
  In the local block-only YiState (where `prog := executeBlock_… 0 …`),
  if `t ≥ 2` execution falls off the end of the block and META halts on
  the next step; if `t < 2` we re-execute one of the block's own
  instructions, which is meaningless absent the surrounding metaProg.

  In the **global** `metaInterpProg` context (deferred to Phase C),
  `t` is an absolute offset into `metaInterpProg`, so the branch
  transfers control to whichever block sits at offset `t` — which is
  the intended semantics.  The sim-side encoding bridge for this case
  requires **dynamic pc-counter rewriting** from
  `encCounter regHex sim.pc` to `encCounter regHex t`, which is a
  multi-cell operation (could shorten or extend the counter).  This
  pure encoding equality is now proved; the concrete META block that
  performs the variable-length rewrite remains deferred.

## §0.2  What is proven in this file

For each block we provide:

- `executeBlock_<op>` — the Lean-level definition (2 instructions).
- `executeBlock_<op>_length`, `_first`, `_second` — structural lemmas.
- `executeBlock_<op>_local_effect_fallthrough` — the FALL-THROUGH case
  (condition FALSE) proven end-to-end on a clean block-only YiState:
  cur unchanged, pc → fetchOffset, history unchanged locally.
- `encMetaHistory_<op>_fallthrough_step` — the sim-side bridge for the
  fall-through case: matches the `nop`-shape head-prepend.
- `encMetaHistory_<op>_taken_step` — the sim-side bridge for the taken
  case: rewrites the leading pc-counter prefix to `encCounter regHex t`
  while preserving the halted flag, simulated history, and encoded
  program tail.

What is **deferred** (with a clear `/-! deferred -/` design note):

- The **branch-taken** local-effect case (TRUE branch jumping to
  absolute `t`).  Locally meaningless without the global metaProg
  context; the global statement requires the surrounding
  `metaInterpProg.extract` hypothesis and lives in Phase C.
- The combined `BlockPre → BlockPost` simulation lemma for both
  branches, which depends on the pieces above.

## §0.3  Why fall-through is the cleanly provable slice

In the fall-through case, sim.pc is bumped by 1 (just like nop), so the
encoding-bridge head-prepend reuses the *exact same proof* as
`encMetaHistory_nop_step`.  The block also happens to behave like
`[ nop ; jump fetchOffset ]` locally because the ISA-level branch op,
when its condition is false, IS a one-cycle nop on cur and just
increments pc.  Hence both the block-side `local_effect` and the
sim-side `encMetaHistory_…_step` reduce to known proven shapes.

/-! ## § 1  branchShiEq block (parameterized by sh : Shi, t : Nat) -/

/-- The `branchShiEq sh t` execute block: a 2-instruction program that
    emits the ISA-level branch opcode, then on the fall-through case
    jumps back to fetch.

    On the **branch-taken** case (`cur.2 = sh`) the inner branch opcode
    sets pc to the absolute target `t`, which in the global metaProg
    context routes to whichever block sits at offset `t`.  In the local
    block-only YiState used by `_local_effect_fallthrough`, that path
    falls off the end of the block (assuming `t ≥ 2`).

    There are |Shi| × |Nat| such blocks at the Lean level (the dispatcher
    routes based on the runtime sh and target cells; the `t` is also
    Lean-level because it is a compile-time absolute offset in the
    eventual metaProg layout). -/

/-! ### Deferred: `branchShiEq sh t` — branch-taken case

The TRUE-branch case requires:

* **Local effect**: when `sim.cur.2 = sh`, the inner branch sets META.pc
  to the absolute target `t`.  In the local block-only YiState (`prog =
  executeBlock_branchShiEq sh t 0 fetchOffset` of length 2), this either:
  - falls off the end (`t ≥ 2`) → next step halts the local META;
  - re-enters the block (`t < 2`) → ill-defined absent the metaProg
    context.

  Neither describes the intended semantics — that arises only in the
  global metaProg where `t` is an offset into `metaInterpProg` and
  routes to another block.  Hence this case has no clean **block-local**
  statement; it is properly stated only as part of the global
  `BlockPre → BlockPost` simulation lemma.

The sim-side encoding equality is no longer deferred; see
`encMetaHistory_branchShiEq_taken_step` above.  What remains is the
concrete META program that performs this variable-length rewrite.
